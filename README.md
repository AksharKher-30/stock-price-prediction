# üìà Apple Stock Price Forecasting

This project builds a hybrid deep learning system to forecast stock prices using a combination of statistical and deep learning models. It blends ARIMA, Prophet, and BiLSTM models in a residual and stacked architecture to improve predictive accuracy over traditional methods.

## üöÄ Project Overview

We use Apple Inc.‚Äôs stock data from 1984‚Äì2025 and apply multiple time series forecasting techniques in a hybrid pipeline:
1. **ARIMA** ‚Äì models trend and linear components
2. **Prophet** ‚Äì models seasonality and holiday effects
3. **BiLSTM with Attention** ‚Äì learns residuals and sequence patterns
4. **Stacked BiLSTM** ‚Äì final prediction using all model outputs, residuals, and technical indicators

## üìò Notebook Workflow Summary

1. EDA & Preprocessing
- Converted the Date column to datetime and set it as the index.
- Resampled data from daily to weekly to reduce noise and focus on long-term trends.
- Visualized trends, volatility, and moving averages to understand behavior.

2. Feature Engineering
- Computed multiple technical indicators:
    - Moving Averages (MA50, MA200, MA7, MA21)
    - EMA (12, 26), MACD, Momentum, RSI
    - Bollinger Bands (upper, lower, 20sd)
- Added Fourier features for cyclic pattern modeling.
- Created lag features (lag_1, lag_2, lag_3, etc.) for sequence learning.
- Added time-based features like Month, Week, Quarter, and Time_Index.

3. Classical Forecasting Models
- üîπ ARIMA
    - Fitted an ARIMA model on the Close price to capture the linear trend component.
    - Stored ARIMA forecast as a separate feature.
- üîπ Prophet (Facebook)
    - Fitted Prophet to model seasonality and event-driven shifts.
    - Stored Prophet forecast and residuals.

4. Residual Modeling with BiLSTM
- Trained BiLSTM on ARIMA and Prophet residuals to capture nonlinear components left unexplained.
- Added BiLSTM-corrected forecasts as improved residual-corrected predictions.

5. BiLSTM + Attention Forecasting
- Created sequence data for supervised learning using windowed past timesteps.
- Built a deep Bidirectional LSTM model with multi-layered architecture.
- Added a custom attention mechanism to assign importance to timesteps dynamically.
- Trained the model and evaluated using RMSE, MAE, MAPE, and R¬≤.
- Visualized attention weights, rolling residuals, and predictions vs. actuals.

6. Preparing Inputs for Stacked Model
- Collected and scaled ARIMA, Prophet, BiLSTM outputs and their residuals.
- Combined these with selected technical indicators (e.g., RSI, momentum, MACD) and Prepared input features as sequences for the stacked BiLSTM model.

7. Stacked BiLSTM Model
- Designed a second-stage BiLSTM using model outputs and indicators as input.
- Tuned architecture and hyperparameters using Optuna.
- Trained on full sequence data to improve accuracy using ensemble of ARIMA + Prophet + BiLSTM.

8. Final Evaluation & Forecasting
- Evaluated all models using:
    - MAE, RMSE, MAPE, R¬≤
- Visualized:
    - Actual vs Predicted (Train/Test/Zoomed)
    - Residuals over time
- Forecasted price on a specific date using the trained model.

## üìå Key Learnings

- Combining classical + deep models boosts robustness and performance.
- Residual learning adds corrective layers to underfitted models like ARIMA.
- Attention mechanisms help interpret time dependency in BiLSTM.
- Proper scaling and lag features significantly impact model accuracy.
